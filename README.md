# CSE100_PA2_Tester
UCSD CSE100 Spring 2016 PA2 Self-Tester for Students. 

WARNING: THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT COME WITH ANY GUARANTEE. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE YOUR CODE WORKS CORRECTLY. 

The tester assumes you have the following PA2 directory sturcture: 
```
.
|-- BitInputStream.cpp
|-- BitInputStream.hpp
|-- BitOutputStream.cpp
|-- BitOutputStream.hpp
|-- HCNode.cpp
|-- HCNode.hpp
|-- HCTree.cpp
|-- HCTree.hpp
|-- Makefile
|-- compress.cpp
|-- ty_tester.sh
|-- pa2_input_files
|   `-- (exact files inside this directory does not matter)
|-- refcompress
|-- refuncompress
`-- uncompress.cpp
```

##  What does the tester do?
1. The tester use `make` to compile your code;
  * The tester will exit if `make` fails.
2. It generates a random binary input file and a random text input file for testing using `openssl rand`;
  * On ieng6, the two files will be 5 [MiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte) in size to keep the running time reasonable;
  * On non-ieng6 machines, the two files will be 10 [MiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte) in size.
3. The tester will loop through all the input files found in `pa2_input_files` to test them;
  * Accuracy test: For each file, the tester will perform a `compress` and `uncompress` and compare the result with the original file;
    * The tester will exit if an accuracy test fails. 
  * Size test: On ieng6, the tester will also  perform a `refcompress` and compare the sizes to make sure your version beats the reference version in compression ratio. 
    * The tester will continue even if an size test fails. 
4. Temporary files generated by the tester will be deleted upon exit. 

## How to use
1. Download the script and place it in the correct location (see above). 
2. `chmod u+x ty_tester.sh`
3. `./ty_tester.sh`

Good luck on this PA!
